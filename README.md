# Website accessibility standards

## Purpose

The purpose of the project was to make a website accessible for people with disabillities, ensuring that all of our potential users will have a good experience. In addition, the page will be better positioned in search engines likeGoogle becauce that is one of the main ways users discover content online.
I was requested to make the CSS style and HTML function with less code.


## Contribution

Semantic HTML elements replaced non-semantic ones. CSS rules were deleted and added to simplify and make it easier for readers.
